This repository contains code for a sentiment analysis project using BERT, 
fine-tuned on a custom dataset of social media posts about emerging technology.
The model classifies text into three categories: positive, neutral, and negative sentiment.
This project was developed using Hugging Face Transformers, and it includes data preprocessing,
training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
